# Create-an-Azure-Resource-Group

What we are going to do now is do one of the prerequisites, which is creating a <b>Resource Group</b> by clicking on "Resource groups" on the Azure services or by searching "Resource groups" on the search bar above the
home page.

After navigating to Resource groups we will click on <b>Create</b>

<br />

Then we select a <b>subscription</b>. In my case I will go with the "Azure Subscription 1" and I'll provide a <b>Resource group name</b> (DemoRG) and on <b>Region</b> I will leave it as is.

Moving on to <b>Tags</b>, I will leave it open, and then click on next.

Validate that everything is correct then click on <b>Create</b>.

After creating the Resource group we will see it on the Resource Group page.

And if we click on the Resource group (DemoRG), we can see the attributes associated with it.
