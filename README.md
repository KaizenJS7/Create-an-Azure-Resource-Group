# Create-an-Azure-Resource-Group

What I am going to do now is do one of the prerequisites, which is creating a <b>Resource Group</b> by clicking on "Resource groups" on the Azure services or by searching "Resource groups" on the search bar above the
home page.

After navigating to Resource groups we will click on <b>Create</b>

<br />

Then you select a subscription. In my case I will go with the "Azure Subscription 1" and I'll provide a name for the Resource group (DemoRG) and on Region I will leave it as is. Moving on to <b>Tags</b>, I will leave
it open, and then click on next.
